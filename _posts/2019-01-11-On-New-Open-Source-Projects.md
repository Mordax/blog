I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to continue to work on open source projects and have them count towards my marks. 

This time around, I wanted to work on two particular sides of open source. One being a new project, with maintainers backed by a large organization, and the other being an extremely old project still in use today. 

I briefly encountered [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) in a [Virtual reality room design competition](https://blog.sketchfab.com/vr-design-challenge-mozilla-hubs-clubhouse/)(I'll probably write about my experiences later). Hubs is a virtual reality meeting room that you can access via browser and can share with just a url. You dont need a VR headset, and you can voice chat, text chat and import 3D models into it. [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) is the preferred repo of VR ready models that work well with Hubs. 

I wanted to work on Hubs namely because I liked the product - [I've been a fan and advocate of browser accessible programs for more than 10 years](https://www.runescape.com/community) (although the game no longer runs in browser), as a young person who lacked the knowledge of how to install games onto my computer. Another reason is to see how a large organization like Mozilla structures its new project endeavours in a sort of organized chaos. 

The other project that I wanted to work on is almost the complete flip side of Hubs. A[fter building and contributing to Firefox for the first time](https://mordax.io/blog/seneca/2018/12/16/On-Building-Firefox.html), I wanted to see what a very old, still in use, great developer tool looks like. So I have decided to try working on [Apache HTTP server](https://httpd.apache.org/). Whereas Firefox was launched in 2002 (ignoring the Netscape era), the Apache server is from 1995. 

Firefox got me to use IRC for the first time - Apache uses mailing lists for its older projects. I want to try out various development environments to see what suits me more. 

And of course, I may potentially head back and keep doing some work for Firefox - it really is an awesome project.
