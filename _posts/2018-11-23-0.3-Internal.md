## Adding a Markdown file output using Rust in supernova  

supernova is a commandline tool made by a friend of mine for grabbing information on starred Github repos and outputting them.  

#### **Issue:**  

[Malformed markdown](https://github.com/0xazure/supernova/issues/11) - looks nice in terminal but doesn't translate into and actual markdown file nicely.  

#### **Solution:**  

Hunted down some Rust file output examples - had done basic readme adjustments but wanted to actually play with Rust so decided to extend the issue to allow a file generation.   

- Include necessary imports to enable file manipulation  
- Initialize the file through creation and indicating location of path 
- Catch errors  
- Loop to print each starred repository  
- Force a 2 space + carriage return to force new lines on each repo printed  


#### **Side Issues:**  

Had a lot of good code review from the maintainer:  

- No ability for the user to indicate what name of the file, where the file is generated or even just not to generate the file  
- Rust-specific best practises not being used (which is interesting, due to most of the tutorials on Rust file generation does not use best practises or even depreciated commands)  
- Getting used to Rust syntax and somehow scrounging up the time to go back and fix up the PR.  


#### **Benefit:**  

Having a nicely formatted, markdown file filled with starred repos can be useful for quick searching and better visualization than via terminal output.
